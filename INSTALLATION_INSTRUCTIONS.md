# Installation Instructions

### Windows
Before installing NVChad, ensure you have gcc (included with mingw64) build tools. These should be installed via chocolatey. If this is not installed properly, you can have lots of issues with treesitter like no syntax highlighting and just generally a whole host of problems.

Install mingw64 via choco
``` console
choco install mingw
```
